## What's For Dinner?
What's for dinner is an easy to use website that will give users recipe suggestions based on search queries.
This obviates the need to sift through a variety of websites for recipe suggestions.  
By creating a favorites list and adding the ability to upload custom recipes we can allow users to create their own digital cookbooks.
By additionally storing ingredient information, What's For Dinner will allow users to quickly and easily generate shopping lists.
All of this together will make What's For Dinner a one-stop-shop for meal preparation, something that the vast majority of households engage in on a daily basis
What's For Dinner is currently running off of the Food2Fork API, but this may change as needs and scale evolve


## Version History
V1.0-- First Release.  Generate a selection of recipe suggestsions based on user inputs

## Usage
--Input search terms into the search bar in the top right of the page (currently only accepts dish names).  Additional searches can be performed from the same bar.
--Results will be populated in the center of the page.  Scroll down to view additional entries.  
--Any image clicked will open a separate browser tab directing to the recipe publisher's page for that recipe.

## Roadmap-- where we're going
1. Generate a favorites page- a link to a separate page allowing users to store their favorite recipes (small format version of initial search return)
2. Add links to all generated entries allowing users to add this recipe to their favorites page
3. Hook up a user login, storage and authentication system to differentiate users in order to:
4. Create storage space for each user to store favorites as they are assigned
5. Add functionality to create and store user-defined recipes (image upload?)
6. Add functionality to scrape and store ingredient information for each recipe
7. Use recipe functionality to generate shopping lists for users based on # of meals plotted
 		Additional notes are necessary here- we want users to be able to plan for different time-lengths and people prepared.  Whether they want to make a single meal for two, or plan one shopping trip to create a week's worth of meals for a family of 4.
8. Investigate the possibility of linking What's for Dinner to sensible companion apps; whether it be amazon delivery methods, supermarket chain pickup services or nutrition trackers for additional meal information
